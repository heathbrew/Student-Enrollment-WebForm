This code is for a webform project that uses jsonpowerDB connectivity. The code is written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap to create a form for student enrollment. 
The form includes input fields for Roll-No, Full-Name, Class, Birth-Date, Address, Enrollment-Date and a save button. 
The JavaScript code includes a function called saveStudent() that is used to validate the form data and send a PUT request to an API. 
The PUT request includes the form data as a JSON string, which is used to update the student's information in the database. 
The primary key of the table is Roll No. The script uses JQuery to get the values from the form fields, check if they are not empty, and create 
a JSON object with the form data. The script also uses the JQuery library to make an ajax request to jsonpowerDB to send the data.
The code also use Bootstrap for styling the form.
